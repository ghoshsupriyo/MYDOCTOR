# Project Description
The Doctor Appointment Booking Website is a full-stack web application that allows patients to easily find and book appointments with doctors online. The platform provides a user-friendly interface where patients can search for doctors by specialty, view their profiles, check availability, and schedule appointments instantly.

The website includes secure user authentication, doctor profile management, appointment scheduling, and an integrated payment gateway for hassle-free transactions. Doctors can log in to manage their schedules, update availability, and view patient details, while the admin panel allows for system-wide management of users, doctors, and appointments.

The system is built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for database management, ensuring a fast, responsive, and scalable platform.
